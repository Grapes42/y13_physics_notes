# Year 13 Physics Notes
Notes made by Max and Holly.

These notes contain all symbols, constants and equations for each standard. As well as any other useful information we add.

All symbols, constants and equations are sorted in alphabetical order and grouped to make finding them easier.

These notes use something called Markdown, so if you get weird text like \\$\\alpha = \\frac...\\$, just wait for it to load. If it doesn't load, try using your computer, it's very finicky on phones.

## Standards
 - [Mechanical Systems](mechanical_systems.md)
 - [Waves](waves.md)
